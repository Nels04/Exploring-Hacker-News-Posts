    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is site started by [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. \n",
    "You can find the data set [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) but it has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to around 20,000 rows by removing posts that didn't receive any comments, then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the columns' descriptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* id: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "* title: The title of the post\n",
    "* url: The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n",
    "* num_points: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "* num_comments: The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "* author: The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "* created_at: The date and time at which the post was submitted\n",
    "    \n",
    "In this project, we are more interested in posts whose titles begin with either **Ask HN** or **Show HN**. Users submit Ask HN to ask the Hacker News community a question. Below is an example of Ask HN\n",
    "\n",
    ">Ask HN: How to improve my personal website?<br>\n",
    ">Ask HN: Am I the only one outraged by Twitter shutting down share counts?<br>\n",
    ">Ask HN: Aby recent changes to CSS that broke mobile?\n",
    "\n",
    "Users submit Show HN to show the community a project, product, or something interesting. Below is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    ">Show HN: Wio Link  ESP8266 Based Web of Things Hardware Development Platform'<br>\n",
    "Show HN: Something pointless I made<br>\n",
    "Show HN: Shanhu.io, a programming playground powered by e8vm\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to compare the 2 types of posts to determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?\n",
    "  * Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
