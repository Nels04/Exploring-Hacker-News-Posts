# Exploring Hacker News Posts
Analyzing the two type of posts on Hacker News to determine which one receive the most comment and if post created at a certain time receive more comment on average.
Hacker News is site started by Y Combinator where user-submitted stories (known as "posts") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. In this project, we are more interested in posts whose titles begin with either Ask HN or Show HN. 
Our goal is to compare the 2 types of posts to determine:
 * Do Ask HN or Show HN receive more comments on average?
 * Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
